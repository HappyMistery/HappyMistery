## Hi there

If you want to know just a little about me, here are a few details:

- I am currently studying **Computer Science** at **URV** (or at least trying to).
- I am interested in **Virtual Reality (VR)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

That's about it for now. If you have any questions or want to connect, feel free to reach out.
